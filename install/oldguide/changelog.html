            <h2 class="subparagraph"><strong>Time formatted in mm/dd/yy</strong></h2>
                <h2 class="install">1/30/21</h2>
                    <p class="subparagraph"> - [Core] Finally re-added Consistent Pip-Boy Icons (I feel like I was waiting for something to re-add it, but I can't remember what it was so whatever. gud mod)</p>
                <h2 class="install">1/24/21</h2>
                    <p class="subparagraph">
                        - [Gameplay] Added Fallout 4 Survival Damage, as its now fully compatible with TTW
                    </p>
                <h2 class="install">1/15/21</h2>
                    <p class="subparagraph">
                        - [Core] Added TTW Wrist Fix (somehow forgot about this for months despite me adding it to VNV already)
                    </p>
                <h2 class="install">1/13/21</h2>
                    <p class="subparagraph">
                        Hey, long time no see! <br>
                        - [Utilities] Added New Vegas Heap Replacer to the Utilities section (finally) <br>
                        - [Utilities] Changed the installations of the Utilities to manually through MO2 with a note about installing them manually if they don't work when installed through MO2 rather than the other way around (i feel like this was a pretty major source of confusion previously, so hopefully this will clear things up and not totally backfire. Oh and if you already have the utilities installed and working manually, there is no need to change anything) <br>
                        - [General] Various instruction improvements since i can never be satisfied
                    </p>
                <h2 class="install">12/16/20</h2>
                    <p class="subparagraph"> You may have noticed a small visual redesign of the site. But other than that, the following changes have been made (oh and sorry I'm too lazy to port over all the old changelogs): <br>
                                            - [General] Separated the sections to make the guide more cohesive (separate visuals/gameplay sections basically) <br>
                                            - [Visuals] Added Improved LOD Noise <br>
                                            - [Gameplay] Removed BLEED (i intend on hopefully converting my damage mod to TTW eventually) <br>
                                            - [Gameplay] Added instructions for enabling more features in JIP/Stewie's Tweaks <br>
                                            - [Gameplay] Added Fallout 3 Economy, Follower Tweaks, and Marathoner <br>
                                            - [Gameplay] Exchanged Immersive Recoil for Real Recoil (real recoil feels 10x smoother imo) <br>
                                            - [Gameplay] Added a custom INI for Real Recoil that adds compatibility for TTW and SawyerBatty <br>
                                            - [Gameplay] Exchanged Just Assorted Mods for a few of the individual Just mods (i only use/recommend the ones in the guide, as the other ones are either unbalanced, too intrusive, or too script-heavy) <br> <br>
                                            Probably missed a thing or two as always ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
